This repository contains a Trello-like project built as part of the [Vue Mastery course](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/build-a-trello-clone-w-nuxt-3/trello-clone-nuxt-introduction) on building a Trello Clone with Nuxt 3.  

## Technologies Used

- **Nuxt 3**: A modern framework built on Vue 3, providing powerful features like server-side rendering (SSR), file-based routing, and automatic imports.
- **Vue 3**: For creating a reactive and component-based user interface.
- **Pinia**: State management library for managing app state in a modular way.
- **Composition API**: Used for structuring logic and reactivity in the project.
- **CSS Modules**: Scoped CSS for styling individual components.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server.
- **Vue Router**: For managing navigation and routing within the app.
- **UI Nuxt Library**: For ready-made UI components and faster development.
- **VueUse**: A collection of utility functions, including local storage handling, for better app functionality.
